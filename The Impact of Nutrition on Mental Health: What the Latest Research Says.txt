The Impact of Nutrition on Mental Health: What the Latest Research Says," published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).

In the study, researchers analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which is conducted every two years by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The survey collects information on the health and nutritional status of more than 40,000 adults and children aged 2 years and older. The researchers found that people who ate the most fruits and vegetables had the lowest rates of depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders, as well as the highest levels of self-esteem and life satisfaction. They also reported that those who consumed the least amount of fruit and vegetable were more likely to be obese and to smoke cigarettes.
